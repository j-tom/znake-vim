## Railscasts theme changed to my personal taste!

The colors of the syntax are nearly the same, I just added some yellow tones e.g. to the cursor or numbers.

Check out the original scripts from the [tomorrow-theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) and of course all the awesome Screencasts at [Railscasts.com](http://railscasts.com/)

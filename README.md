## Railscasts theme changed to my personal taste!

The colors of the syntax are nearly the same, I just changed the Background from darkgray to black and added some Pink and Redtones for selecting Text and so on. 

Check out the original from [Nick Moffitt](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2175) and of course all the awesome Screencasts at [Railscasts.com](http://railscasts.com/)
